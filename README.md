# ASM-Math
<p>Mathematical floating-point functions coded in x86 and x64 Assembly for NASM.</p>
<p>ASM-Math aims to find a reasonable balance between accuracy and speed. This means
that all results should be correct. However, rounding errors might cause the last digit
to be wrong.</p>
<p>Currently there is no version of this library that uses the AVX instruction set.</p>
